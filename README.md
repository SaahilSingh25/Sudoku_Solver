Sudoku_Solver
This is a sudoku solver that utilizes constraint propagation to solve puzzles up to size 4x4x4.
The project was built using strictly Python, and solves the problem using constraint propagation.
This AI can solve 100 9x9x9 puzzles of increasing difficulty in under 8 seconds.
You can find the code for the project in the .py file, and some unsolved puzzles in the folder.
